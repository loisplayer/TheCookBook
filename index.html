    <h2>Welcome to our Cookbook</h2>
    <p> The most wonderful cookbook in all of the land! </p> 
    <p1> Through our website, we're going to take you on a culturally enlightening trip all across Europe, from one restaurant to the next. From London, to Paris, to Lisbon- this is going to be the most intense whistle-stop tour across Europe you've ever encountered. We've tried out recipes so you don't have to, and picked the best ones- just for you. </p1>
<p3> We've hand picked the best recipe books and places to experience the food culture of Europe for you. We're excited to take you on this adventure. If you want to be part of our diverse community, please feel free to register for regular updates through our website. </p3>

    <p> I am Iwona and everyday I work as a Paralegal. While I am not at work, you will most likely find me somewhere in Europe travelling or cooking. I love to travel and explore new places- in particular restaurants and food from around the wrold. In my spare time, I cook and learn how to program. If you want to learn more about my adventures, please follow me on my social media: (here I will want to insert instagram, snapchat logo and links)</p>

    <h2> Meet Lois</h2>
    <img src="headshot EF.jpg" style="width:24em; height:24em"/>
    <p> I'm Lois, and I work at Entrepreneur First on the Programme Team. I spend my days carrying out operations for my team, from organising large scale events, to handling external partnerships. I'm a keen Psychology fanatic, and will begin studying Psychology at University in September. When not at work, I'm always keen to seek out new experiences. Whether this be through a chilled weekend in London, travelling across the wilderness of the British countryside with only a rucksack, or interrailing across the major cities across Europe- most of these adventures involve food in some way. Having visited so many European countries, it amazes me how cultures and traditions in food vary. Food is at the centre-point of our lives, and that's why we're passionate about making good advice about food accessible. If you want to connect, feel free to follow me on social media.</p>
