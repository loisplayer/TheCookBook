    <h2> Meet Iwona</h2>
    <p> I am Iwona and everyday I work as a Paralegal. While I am not at work, you will most likely find me somewhere in Europe travelling or cooking. I love to travel and explore new places- in particular restaurants and food from around the wrold. In my spare time, I cook and learn how to program. If you want to learn more about my adventures, please follow me on my social media: (here I will want to insert instagram, snapchat logo and links)</p>

    <h2> Meet Lois</h2>
    <p> I'm Lois, and I work at Entrepreneur First on the Programme Team. I spend my days carrying out operations for my team, from organising large scale events, to handling external partnerships. I'm a keen Psychology fanatic, and will begin studying Psychology at University in September. When not at work, I'm always keen to seek out new experiences- most of which involve food in some form. Having visited so many European countries, it amazes me how cultures and traditions in food vary. Food is at the centrepoint of our lives, and that's why we're passionate about making good advice about food accessible. </p>
