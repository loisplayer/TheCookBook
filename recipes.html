 <h3> Deliciously Ella's Chestnut, Spinach and Mushroom Tart </h3>

 <p> Ingredients (serves 4): </p>
 <p> </p>
<p> For the pastry: </p>
<ul>
<li> 100g of ground almonds </li>
<li> 100g of gram flour </li>
<li> 50g of corn flour </li>
<li> Salt and pepper </li>
<li> 75g of coconut oil </li>
<li> 6 tablespoons of cold water </li>
<p> </p>
<p> For the filling: </p>
<li> 1 red onion </li>
<li> 4 cloves of garlic </li>
<li> ½ butternut squash (200g) </li>
<li> 180g of chestnut mushrooms</li>
<li> 2 big handfuls of spinach(60g)</li>
<li> 250g of pre-cooked chestnuts</li>
<li> ½ a lemon, juiced</li>
<li> Olive oil</li>
<li> 1 teaspoon of dried herbs (I used rosemary and thyme)</li>
<p> </p>
<p> For the Cashew Cheese: </p>
<li> 75g of cashew nuts (soaked for at least 4 hours) </li>
<li> 2 teaspoons of nutritional yeast </li>
<li>Salt and pepper </li>
<li> ½ a lemon, juiced </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons of water </li>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li> Start by making the pastry. In a large mixing bowl combine all the pastry ingredients with your hands, then roll the dough into a ball and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to cool. </li>
<li> Preheat the oven to 180C (fan). Roll the pastry out flat between two sheets of greaseproof paper then press it down into a greased tart tin (mine is 24cm diameter). Pierce the pastry a few times with a fork then bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until just starting to turn golden brown. </li>
<li> While the pastry cooks you can make the filling. Peel and slice the onion, peel and finely chop the garlic and peel and grate the squash. Heat a glug of olive oil in a pan and add the onions, then cook for a few minutes, stirring continuously. </li>
<li> Slice all the mushrooms (apart from 2 of them) and add them into the pan along with the garlic. Cook for 2 minutes then add in the grated squash, spinach, lots of salt and pepper, the dried herbs, and lemon juice. Cook the mixture for another 5 minutes. </li>
<li> While that cooks, drain and cashews and blend with the water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast and salt and pepper. When this is smooth, stir it into the vegetables. </li>
<li> Cut the chestnuts in half and add them to the vegetable mixture, then spoon all of this into the pastry case. Slice the two remaining mushrooms and arrange them on top of the tart, then bake the tart for 18-20 minutes until the mushrooms on top are cooked. </li>

<h3> Jamie Oliver's Tomato, Red Wine and Chorizo Risotto </h3>
<p> Ingredients (serves 4): </p>
<ul>
<li> Olive oil </li>
<li> 2 shallots</li>
<li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
<li> 80g higher-welfare chorizo </li>
<li> ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
<li>750ml–1 litre of organic chicken or vegetable stock</li>
<li>1 x 400 g tin of quality chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>300 g risotto rice</li>
<li>200 ml red wine</li>
<li>50 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve</li>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Peel and finely chop the shallots and garlic, finely chop the chorizo, then pick and finely chop the parsley leaves, finely chopping the stalks.</li>
<li> Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a wide, shallow pan. Add the parsley stalks, shallot, garlic and chorizo to the heated oil and cook over a medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the shallot is softened and the chorizo is beginning to crisp. </li>
<li> Meanwhile, in another pan, heat the stock with the tinned tomatoes. Add the rice to the shallot mixture and stir to coat the grains. Cook over a high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the grains have cracked and are slightly translucent at the tips, then pour in the red wine.</li>
<li> Stir well and cook until almost all the wine has evaporated. Add the hot stock and tomato mixture, ladle by ladle, stirring well with each addition, and only adding more when the previous ladle is almost fully absorbed. You may not need all of the mixture, or you may need to top it up with a little water. </li>
<li> The rice should be tender but with a little bite in the middle. When it’s cooked, add one last ladle of liquid.
Finely grate the Parmesan, then add to the pan with some seasoning. Stir well, take off the heat and cover. Leave for 5 minutes or so before stirring again, tasting and adjusting the seasoning, if necessary. </li>
<li> Serve topped with extra grated Parmesan and the chopped parsley leaves. </li>
</ol>
